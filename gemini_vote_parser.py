    Analyze this raw text from a city council meeting vote and extract the individual councilmember votes.

    Raw text:
    {raw_text}

    Please return ONLY a JSON object with the councilmember names as keys and their votes as values.
    Use these exact councilmember names: MIKE GERSON, JON KAJI, SHARON KALANI, BRIDGET LEWIS, AURELIO MATTUCCI, ASAM SHEIKH
    Use these exact vote values: YES, NO, ABSTAIN

    If a councilmember is not present in the text, do not include them in the result.
    If the vote is unclear, use ABSTAIN.

    Example format:

        "SHARON KALANI": "ABSTAIN"
